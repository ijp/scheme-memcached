* An R6RS Memcached Client

** What is it?

A R6RS Scheme library for dealing with the Memcached caching
daemon. Currently it only supports Guile, more will be added shortly.

Right now, the library is a little simplistic. It only supports
communicating with a single Memcached instance, and expects you to
deal with bytevectors.

**  API

Users are expected to import the (memcached) library.
